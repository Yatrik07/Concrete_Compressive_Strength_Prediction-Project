# Concrete_Compressive_Strength_Prediction-Project

### PROJECT IS ONGOING, WILL BE COMPLETED AND UPLOADED SOON.

### Problem Statement: 
<p align="justify">The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we need for acceptable compressive strength. </p>

### Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

### Architecture:
-> Start  <br>
-> Data(Batches) for Training <br>
-> Data Validation <br>
-> Data Transformation <br>
-> Data Insertion in Database <br>
->  Export Data from database to CSV from training <br>
-> Data Preprocessing <br>
-> Data Clustering <br>
-> Get Best model for each cluster <br>
-> Hyperparameter Tuning <br>
-> Model Saving <br>
-> Cloud Setup <br>
-> Pushing App to cloud <br>
-> Application Start <br>
-> Data from Client to be Predicted <br>
-> Data Perprocessing <br>
-> Data CLustering <br>
-> Model call for specific cluster <br>
-> Prediction <br>
-> End <br>


### Results: 
To build a solution that should able to predict the compressive strength of the concrete.
